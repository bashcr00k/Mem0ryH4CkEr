# Mem0ryH4CkEr
Scan and edit values stored in memory regions

This is basically a tool that does the same as cheat engine back in the day !

- you first choose a program this tool will print all running processes or the programs with visible windows with their pids along

- after you select the process you want to hack you have to copy the pid into the tool

- after that you have to give it the value that it will look for then it will print out a lot of memory addresses probably thousands containing that value

- finally you have to repeat this process at least twice everytime you have to change the value in the target proccess for example if you want to hack minecraft to get a lot of diamonds you want to throw a diamond every time and enter the new diamond amount until you are left with one or two memory addresses

- now all you have to do is edit the memory address you have to copy the address to the tool manually (might improve that in the near future) and thats it you should see the change in the target process

The goal of this tool was to learn more about how memory works in windows as well as how to enumerate processes using windows api 

If you find any problems inform me ! 

Happy Hacking ;)))) !!!!
